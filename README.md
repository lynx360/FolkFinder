## Introduction
This repository contains a tracking algorithm to detect when a person has entered
This repository is based off https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch. It contains a two-stage-tracker. The detections generated by [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, are passed to a [Deep Sort algorithm](https://github.com/ZQPei/deep_sort_pytorch) which tracks the objects. It can track any object that the Yolov5 model was trained to detect.





## Before you run the tracker

1. Clone the repository recursively:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lynx360/Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch`

If you already cloned and forgot to use `--recurse-submodules` you can run `git submodule update --init`

2. Make sure that you fulfill all the requirements: Python 3.8 or later with all [requirements.txt]) dependencies installed, including torch>=1.7. To install, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Download the YOLOv5 weights from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gglIwqxaH2iTvy6lZlXuAcMpd_U0GCUb/view to  yolov5/weights/crowdhuman_yolov5m.pt

## Tracking sources

Tracking can be run using the following script

```bash
python track.py --source (videoname) --yolo_weights yolov5/weights/crowdhuman_yolov5m.pt --show-vid

```
